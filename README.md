# parser

This parser is generated to read a C code and break it down into various elemnts and check for type equivalences between different variables based on their datatypes.

a.txt: input file. Can be modified

code.cpp: contains the code for the parser. Currently takes care of primitive datatypes, struct declarations and typedefs.
